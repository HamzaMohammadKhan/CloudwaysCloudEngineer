in reverse proxy we have to edit the following files:

in Varnish: 
default.vcl in etc/varnish 
	you have to edit the port ( change it 8081 ) and host ( your local host if you are doing it on a local server )
	in vcl_deliver add these lines:
		 if (obj.hits > 0) {
                set resp.http.X-Varnish-Cache = "HIT";
            }
            else {
                set resp.http.X-Varnish-Cache = "MISS";
        }
        
varnish.service in lib/systemd/system/
	in this file change the listen port -a:6081 to -a:8080

in Nginx:
nginx.conf you have to add in http the code 
	upstream backend {
                server 127.0.0.1:8080 fail_timeout=1s max_fails=2 weight=5;
                server 127.0.0.1:8081 backup;
                #server Backend_Server_IP;
       }
       
go to sites-available then go to default file add the code in location / { 
		  proxy_pass http://backend;
                 proxy_set_header Host $host;
                 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	}

In Apache:
edit the ports.conf 
	just uncomment Listen and change 8080 to 8081

then go to sites-available
edit the virtual host to 8081
